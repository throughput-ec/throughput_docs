# Throughput Widget and Tokens

Throughput uses ORCID to ensure user trust within the database.  While any user can access data from Throughput, only users who have been authorized through ORCID can post data to Throughput.  Data can be posted to Throughput in two ways: (1) directly through the [throughputdb.com]() website once a user is logged in; and (2) using the API through `POST` statements.
